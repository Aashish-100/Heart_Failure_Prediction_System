# Heart_Failure_Prediction_System
Machine Learning is a great technology tool to solve real world problems. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Thus, using Machine Learning techniques we can predict the occurence of heart failure of a person based on various health parameters and lifestyle parameters.
The system uses the SVC class of the Support Vector Machine algorithm.
